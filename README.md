## Overview of SENSE

SENSE is an advanced machine learning framework that integrates multiple AI methodologies into a cohesive, adaptive system. It addresses the limitations of static models by providing real-time adaptability and continuous learning. The framework combines **evolutionary algorithms**, **reinforcement learning**, **online learning**, **anomaly detection**, and **system resource management**, making it suitable for a wide range of complex applications.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Prerequisites
Before you install SENSE, ensure you have:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Git
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `requests`, `transformers`, `psutil`

#### Steps
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pwnzersaurus/SENSE.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the SENSE Directory:
   ```bash
   cd SENSE
   ```
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

To configure SENSE, modify the settings in the `config` directory, particularly the `config.json` file. Key parameters include:
- **state_size**: Number of states in the model.
- **action_size**: Number of possible actions in the reinforcement learning agent.
- **learning_rate**: Rate at which the model learns.
- **drift_threshold**: Sensitivity for detecting data drift.
- **anomaly_sensitivity**: Controls the tolerance for anomaly detection.

Example configuration snippet:
```json
{
  "state_size": 10,
  "action_size": 4,
  "learning_rate": 0.001,
  "drift_threshold": 0.05,
  "anomaly_sensitivity": 0.8
}
```

## Architectural Details

### Evolutionary Algorithms
SENSE employs evolutionary algorithms inspired by natural selection to optimize models. These include:
- **Mutation**: Introduces random changes to model parameters.
- **Crossover**: Combines the parameters of two models to create a new model.
- **Selection**: Retains models with the best performance metrics.

### Reinforcement Learning (SARSA Agent)
The SARSA agent optimizes decision-making in dynamic environments. Key parameters include:
- **epsilon**: Exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
- **gamma**: Discount factor for future rewards.
- **alpha**: Learning rate for updating Q-values.

### Online Learning Module
This module ensures real-time adaptability by processing new data as it becomes available. It supports:
- Data formats: CSV, JSON, and API streams.
- Dynamic model updates based on new data streams.

### Anomaly Detection
The anomaly detection component ensures model reliability by identifying irregularities in data. Users can configure:
- **Thresholds**: Adjust sensitivity for anomaly detection.
- **Alerts**: Enable notifications for detected anomalies.

### System Resource Monitoring
SENSE dynamically adjusts its operations based on system performance. Monitored metrics include:
- CPU and GPU usage
- Memory consumption
- Processing times

## Usage Examples

### Basic Data Analysis
Use SENSE's built-in functions to load and preprocess your data:
```python
from sense import SENSE_Evolver

# Load and preprocess data
data = SENSE_Evolver.load_data('path/to/your/data.csv', 'target_column')
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = SENSE_Evolver.preprocess_data(data)

# Initialize SENSE
sense_system = SENSE_Evolver(
    state_size=10,
    action_size=4,
    input_dim=train_X.shape[1],
    output_dim=1
)

# Run SENSE for a few generations
sense_system.evolve_population(
    sense_system.create_population(),
    (val_X, val_y),
    train_X
)
```

### Advanced Scenario: Handling Data Drift
This example shows how SENSE can handle data drift:
```python
from sense import SENSE_Evolver

# Initialize SENSE
sense_system = SENSE_Evolver(
    state_size=10,
    action_size=4,
    input_dim=new_data.shape[1],
    output_dim=1
)

# Check for data drift
if sense_system.check_data_drift(new_data, old_data):
    population = sense_system.create_population()  # Reset models due to drift
else:
    population = sense_system.evolve_population(
        sense_system.create_population(),
        (val_X, val_y),
        new_data
    )
```

## FAQs

1. **How do I adjust the learning rate?**
   - Edit the `learning_rate` parameter in `config.json` under the `config` directory.

2. **What are the system requirements for SENSE?**
   - Python 3.6 or higher, TensorFlow 2.x, and at least 8GB of RAM. A GPU is recommended for large datasets.

3. **What data formats does SENSE support?**
   - SENSE supports CSV files, JSON objects, and real-time API streams.

4. **How can I monitor performance?**
   - Use the resource monitoring module, which logs metrics such as CPU, GPU, and memory usage.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Installation Errors**:
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again to ensure all dependencies are installed.
   - Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is being used.

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - Reduce `state_size` and `action_size` in the configuration file to lower complexity.
   - Use a GPU for training large models.

3. **Unexpected Errors**:
   - Check logs in the `logs` directory for detailed error messages.
