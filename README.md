SENSE: Systematic Enhancement for Neural Selection and Evolution

## Introduction  
SENSE is a sophisticated AI framework that merges various machine learning techniques into a single, highly adaptive system. It's crafted for scenarios where data evolves, and models need to adapt autonomously over time.

## Key Features  
- Evolutionary Algorithms: Employs genetic algorithms for model optimization, ensuring models evolve with changing data landscapes.  
- Reinforcement Learning (SARSA Agent): Enhances decision-making with an epsilon-greedy strategy for action selection.  
- Online Learning: Utilizes LSTM for learning from sequential data, allowing for real-time adaptation.  
- Anomaly Detection: Uses autoencoders to identify outliers, ensuring data quality and model relevance.  
- System Resource Monitoring: Dynamically adjusts computational load based on system resource usage.  
- Data Drift and Model Degradation Handling: Automatically detects and mitigates issues related to data drift or model performance degradation.

## Quick Start Guide  

### 1. Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.6 or newer  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- Additional libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, requests, transformers, psutil  

### 2. Installation  
Run the following commands:  
git clone https://github.com/pwnzersaurus/SENSE.git  
cd SENSE  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

### 3. Running SENSE  

For local data:  
python sense.py --data_source path/to/your/data.csv --target_column your_target_column  

For URL-based data:  
python sense.py --data_source http://example.com/data.csv --target_column your_target_column

## Usage Examples  

### Basic Data Analysis  
Use SENSE's built-in functions to analyze your data:  

from sense import SENSE_Evolver  

# Load and preprocess data  
data = SENSE_Evolver.load_data('path/to/your/data.csv', 'target_column')  
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = SENSE_Evolver.preprocess_data(data)  

# Initialize SENSE  
sense_system = SENSE_Evolver(  
    state_size=10,  
    action_size=4,  
    input_dim=train_X.shape[1],  
    output_dim=1  
)  

# Run SENSE for a few generations  
sense_system.evolve_population(  
    sense_system.create_population(),  
    (val_X, val_y),  
    train_X  
)  

### Advanced Scenario: Handling Data Drift  
This example demonstrates how SENSE adapts to data drift:  

from sense import SENSE_Evolver  

# Assuming 'new_data' and 'old_data' are your datasets  
sense_system = SENSE_Evolver(  
    state_size=10,  
    action_size=4,  
    input_dim=new_data.shape[1],  
    output_dim=1  
)  

# Check for drift  
if sense_system.check_data_drift(new_data, old_data):  
    population = sense_system.create_population()  # Reset models due to drift  
else:  
    population = sense_system.evolve_population(  
        sense_system.create_population(),  
        (val_X, val_y),  
        new_data  
    )  

# Continue with model evolution or training

## Note  
- Ensure your data source file or URL is accessible and contains the correct format (CSV with headers).  
- Adjust parameters like state_size, action_size, etc., based on your specific problem domain.  
- The system is designed to run autonomously but can be further customized for specific use cases through the command-line arguments or programmatically.
